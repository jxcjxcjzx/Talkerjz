for all children tend to unconsciously
or subconsciously copy everything
including bad ones from their parents
 Another deficiency of parents as teachers
is the fact that most parents are lack
of common senses of education
 All too often we observe some parents
tend to pursue their cherished but failed
dream by forcing their children to develop
in a prearranged direction
In fact, it is the parents rather than their
children that virtually disobey common
senses
 We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated
by multiplying and at the same time becomes
more and more specialized
 Psychology studies have shown us
that parents' love sometimes has
astonishing magic power to their children
