To enable the use of the national finding
project for you to get something interesting
to be found everywhere and anytime you
like, we are pleasure to be here to show
you all the ultimate blue print and the detailed
act guidence for the national naming rules
for pics and all the materials grabbed by 
our national set database, and we are 
especially glad to be here to represent 
the most intelligent ones today to show you 
the excellent ways to manage things and
knowledge today for you to study and recall
someday when you need them.
And the goal for our project is this: we
make the knowledge close enough to
you all, and make everything possible for
you all to touch and feel.
And thank you all for supporting us in this
awesome project.
