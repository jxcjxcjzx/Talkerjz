Now maybe the mark of the day about
two years after I coming to this university
in Nanjing, and time flies, I just have learned
how to use this expression today.
It is turning cold and my heart just acts
the same, and what just teach me, about
the society, the people living in society,
how to adapt to what maybe disgusting,
to learn to be humble, just not because
you would like to act like that way, and
anything alse necessary for a good living
or just a high income in the future, yes,
that is the life, not long from now will you
be able to figure out, to see clearly how
the whole system of common customs
have effect on you, how people make you
upset or depressed someday, and not
to mention, how you should act like causion
and carefully not to break some forbidens
of people around you. yes, that's what a 
student in China has learned in his senior
high, the innovation part, the great and exciting
things just like a short time of bloosm
and just disappeared soon.
And this is the time for a change to take place
, I believe, in nothing, and may god bless me.
