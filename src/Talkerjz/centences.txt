advancement in an increasingly
competitive job market
 Before attending college, students have a 
limited opportunity to specilize
for instance
 with a large range of potential jobs to
choose from
 because of the extent to which a college
degree is accepted by employers as
proof of competence in a given field
college graduates are not only more 
likely to receive more job offers, they can
also command higher salaries than
applicants who lack diplomas
