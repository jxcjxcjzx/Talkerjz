The file named after 'wordnet2.txt' is what the program I write use and all should be under this specified name if is to be in use.

And current file if for the tofel test

and the 'gre.txt' is the new set file for future use.


good luck, and wish you nice experience with this

well, keep this in mind : the first two lines in each file , do not delete them, cause they have effect on the fluent running of the software, the first two line appear as following:
abandon
deliver,giveup,indulge,surrender,yield

quite awkward, but it works in this way, best wishes!
